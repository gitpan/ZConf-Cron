ZConf-Cron

ZConf::Cron manages cron tab entries for  ZConf. Two utilies are included.
'zccron' and 'zccrontab'. 'zccron' runs the tabs.

This is aimed at being a single pass cron for running when ever one wants. My
motivization for writing this was for the purpose of loading the current days
web comics in firefox.
